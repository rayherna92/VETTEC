                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    My journey starts all the way back in the year 1992. I was born in Los Angeles, California to a pair of young but wonderful parents. Shortly after celebrating my second birthday, my parents decided to move to Washington, D.C. I grew up on the eastern coast of the United States and have lived here for most of my life. During my school years, I have always been intrigued by math, science, and music. As such, I excelled in my math and sciences class, took computer programming and gaming design classes, and was part of the school bands (concert, jazz, and marching) since early as 6th grade.

                <h3>Decision, Decisions, Decisions</h3>
                <p>
                    After graduating high school, my plan had always been to join the military. I was initially going to join the Air Force, but my father insisted on me going to college and so I decided to apply to a single school, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Surprisingly, I got accepted. I attended pursuing a degree in computer science. I did alright for my first year, but sadly quickly lost discipline in my studies and started to fail. In my sophomore year, I decided to drop-out and finally join the military. This time, with my older brother, we joined the US Navy.

                <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
                <p>
                    I completed 10 years of active service for the US Navy, and currently I am in the reserves. I do not regret my decision in joining, it probably has been the best for me. I was very immature and lacked self-discipline in the pursuit of my own goals. As challenging as the military can be, I learned many valuable lessons and got to experience some incredible things. Traveling became possible for me, and Iâ€™ve seen more of the world than I ever thought I would. Overall, the military gave me the opportunity to leave the starting line, well really it pushed me to finally leave. Through it, I have learned to overcome many obstacles of life, and I believe it has gained me strength, courage, and discipline to continue on pursuing even greater heights in life.

                <h3>Introspection And The Future</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, I am back to my original starting line, but this is lap two. I have now gained the much needed qualities and experience I need to progress and really pursue something that interests me and can provide for an even better future. Not to say that there isn't more to learn in life, but I am now better equiped.  All of this would not have been possible without the support of my family, friends, and mentors that I have met over the past 30 years. Now it's time to continue forward onto the next chapter of my life.
